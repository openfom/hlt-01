Summary

hlt-01 is a wearable behavioral sensing and feedback device designed for small animals. It continuously streams data to the cloud using Wi-Fi, where the information is processed to extract meaningful behavioral events. These events can be used to notify owners, automate interactions, track trends, and provide real-time or historical insights into animal behavior.

The device features a bi-directional interface, allowing both passive observation (via sensors) and active engagement (via sound and haptic feedback). It is well-suited for pet monitoring, behavioral training, and connected care environments.

Core Capabilities
	•	Motion sensing: 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope for movement classification.
	•	Sound detection: Microphone input for vocal behavior (e.g. barking).
	•	Environmental sensing: Onboard temperature sensor for detecting overheating or ambient conditions.
	•	Biometric integration (optional): Interfaces for pulse or respiration tracking.
	•	Feedback output: Piezo buzzer and vibration motor for interacting with the animal.
	•	Online behavioral inference: Sensor data streamed to the cloud for processing and classification.
	•	Event-driven architecture: Behavior events trigger notifications, logs, or remote feedback.
	•	Remote actuation: Sound and haptic signals triggered from cloud or mobile interfaces.
	•	Connectivity: Wi-Fi enabled, with optional support for Wi-Fi 6/7 location services.

Goals
	•	Provide a cloud-connected wearable platform for behavioral monitoring and interaction.
	•	Enable semantic event detection (e.g. “barking”, “sleeping”, “overheating”) based on multi-sensor data fusion.
	•	Deliver real-time notifications and allow programmatic feedback to the animal.
	•	Offer an extensible event model suitable for both home automation and research-grade behavior tracking.
	•	Support spatial awareness (location inference) using Wi-Fi 6/7 positioning features.

Non-Goals
	•	On-device inference or offline behavior detection.
	•	High-precision location tracking (e.g. GPS/UWB).
	•	Continuous audio/video streaming.

Example Events

| Event Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| dog.sleeping | Sustained stillness, stable temperature |
| dog.barking | Detected vocalization with matched pattern |
| dog.playing | Intermittent high-movement segments |
| env.too_hot | Temperature exceeds comfort threshold |
| feedback.vibrate | Manual or automated haptic interaction |
| feedback.sound | Manual or automated sound interaction |
| device.offline | Loss of connectivity or power |
| device.low_battery | Battery level below threshold |

Use Cases
	•	Pet monitoring: Receive alerts when barking, overheating, or inactivity is detected.
	•	Behavioral training: Trigger remote feedback (buzz or vibration) as reinforcement or intervention.
	•	Longitudinal analysis: Log behavior over time for pattern detection or research.
	•	Home automation: Integrate with smart home systems to act on animal behavior.
	•	Spatial context: Estimate approximate location via Wi-Fi 6/7 and include in behavior reports.

Intent

hlt-01 is built as a network-native wearable platform for animal behavior sensing and interaction. It aims to simplify pet and animal care by turning complex sensor data into human- or system-readable events, while also enabling controlled interaction via feedback actuators.

Though initially focused on pets (primarily dogs), the platform is extensible to other domains including:
	•	Multi-animal facilities (e.g. shelters, training centers)
	•	Assistance animals (with structured routines)
	•	Early research into animal wellness and behavioral health

The long-term goal is to make animal-state awareness programmable, privacy-conscious, and seamlessly integrated into digital environments.
